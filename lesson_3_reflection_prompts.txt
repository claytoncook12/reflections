Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes allows the user to keep track of the files and changes they are making and
	decide when would be best to merge there changes to the repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are clones that stay on github. Clones are copys of repositories. Branches are
	divergences from a present code base. Forks for using other peoples work
	on github, clones for pulling work from github on to a local machine, and branches for 
	when a user want to change something about the code base but still wants a working/production
	version of the code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	This allows for the user to have a state to work off of without the internet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Could share files using dropbox, but the files would have to be manually tracked, such as renaming
	files. It would definetly be harder to track files and keep up with the most up to date versions.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	Making changings in a different branch allows for review when doing a pull request and allows for
	a more collaborative environment
