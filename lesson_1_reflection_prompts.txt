How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The two variations between the files was clearly seen in diff printout.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    This allows for me to be able to see how a file has changed and be able
    to restore the file to a better past version easily, additionally it would
    allow for more freedom to code and not worry about breaking the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are that the user decides when it is useful to save a version, the 
    con is that the user may miss changes it they forget.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The files are related and are important to be saved together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The git log command shows the id of a past version and it can restore to that 
    version to look at. Diff can show the individal changes in a file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Allows for more freedom in changes in the code base and not worry about breaking 
    the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to be able to use git to build a database for work pictures in
    google earth and have custom styles and such.
